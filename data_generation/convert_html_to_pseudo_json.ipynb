      "  ( 2 ) for purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges , earnings consist of earnings before income taxes minus income from equity investees plus fixed charges . fixed charges consist of interest expense and the portion of rental expense we believe is representative of the interest component of rental expense . ( a ) for the years ended december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , earnings available for fixed charges were inadequate to cover fixed charges by $ 37.0 million and $ 461.2 million , respectively . ( 3 ) ebitda is defined as consolidated net income ( loss ) before interest expense , income tax expense ( benefit ) , depreciation , and amortization . adjusted ebitda , which is a measure defined in our credit agreements , is calculated by adjusting ebitda for certain items of income and expense including ( but not limited to ) the following : ( a ) non-cash equity-based compensation ; ( b ) goodwill impairment charges ; ( c ) sponsor fees ; ( d ) certain consulting fees ; ( e ) debt-related legal and accounting costs ; ( f ) equity investment income and losses ; ( g ) certain severance and retention costs ; ( h ) gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt ; ( i ) gains and losses from asset dispositions outside the ordinary course of business ; and ( j ) non-recurring , extraordinary or unusual gains or losses or expenses . we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the table below . both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered non-gaap financial measures . generally , a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company 2019s performance , financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap . non-gaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies , even when similar terms are used to identify such measures . we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service , capital expenditures and working capital requirements . adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements . the following unaudited table sets forth reconciliations of net income ( loss ) to ebitda and ebitda to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented: .\n",
